# scaler  - 45 (a number)
# vector  - [8, 4, 5, 6] (row | column list or array of numbers)
# matrix  - [0, 5]
        #   [8, 8]

# Mean      :- Missing values in a dataset can be replaced with a mean value, if the data is uniformly distributed
# Median    :- Missing values in a dataset can be replaced with a median value if the data is skewed
# Mode      :- Missing values in a dataset can be replaced with a mode value if the data is skewed. Missing categorical values can also be replaced 
            # with mode value 

# To remove a missing field values: dataset.dropna()
# To replace or change value: dataset.replace(('Field Name: ('value': 0, 'value': 1)), implace=True)


# Supervised Learning Models
- Classification Model :- this model is about predicting class or discrect values e.g. male or female, true or false
    - Logistic Regression 
    - Support Vector Machine Classifier
    - Decision Tree
    - K-Nearest Neigbours
    - Random Forest 
    - Naive Bayes Classifier 

- Regression :- this type of model is about predicting a quantity or continious values e.g. Salary, age, price
    - Linear Regression 
    - Lasso Regression 
    - Polynomial Regression
    - Support Vector Machine Regressor 
    - Random Forest Regressor
    - Bayesian Linear Regressor


# Unsupervised Learning Model :- here the machine Learning algorithim learns from unlabelled data
- Unsupervised Learning Model Types
    - Clustering 
        - K-Means Claustering
        - Hierarchical Claustering
        - Pricipal Component Analysis (PCA)
        - Apriori
        - Eclat
    - Association 

# How to choose the right model (Model Selection)
    -: Selecting model depends on factors such as dataset, tasks, nature of model etc

    1. Type of Data Available
        a. images & videos - CNN (convertion neural network)
        b. Text data or Speech data - RNN
        c. Numerical Data - SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree etc.

    2. Based on task we need to carry out 
        a. Classification task - SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree etc.
        b. Regression task - Linear Regression, Random Forest, Polynomial Regression etc.
        c. Clustering task - K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering
